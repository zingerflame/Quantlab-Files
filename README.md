# Time-Series-CUSUM-Triple-Barrier
For QuantLab Interview: CUSUM Filter for label generation and Triple Barrier Method for Label classification on a Time Series

Code file:
- can change stock import on lines 8-11
- Makes returns time series using manual EWM implementation
- Verification code commented out
- Uses CUSUM filter to get events for labelling
- Computes volatility as a property for labelling
- Implements and plots triple barrier method (plot is kinda wonky)
